    NOTE - in the real world this algorithm would be in the backend so we could query the database to only give us products 
    related to our search as opposed to getting every physical product in the database. However, since there's currently only
    about 15 products in the database it's really not a big deal. A future batch should move this search functionality to the
    backend once more products get added for better efficiency.

        /*
        As a final check, see if the currentSearchWord is "similar" to the current product. This is accomplished
        by scanning each charcter in the currentSearchWord until it's found in the current product name. Once it's
        found, move onto the next character (however, don't search product name from beginning, start at current
        position). If at least 80% of the characters in the currentSearchWord are found in the product name in this
        manner it will be considered "close enough".
        
        As an example of this block in action, let's pretend we want to search for the word "black", but we make a
        typo and forget the 'a' so we instead search on "blck". We'd find no matches from the above two IF statements.
        With the below FOR loop and IF statement, however, the 'b', 'l', 'c' and 'k' characters would all be found in
        the appropriate order in the products named "black_hat" and "black_shirt". Flipping the script now, if we
        searched on the word "blue" then only the characters 'b' and 'l' would be found. Since only 2 of the 4 letters
        in the input were matched (50%) and we require 80% of characters to be found, then neither of the "black" products
        would be found. If our search query only consisted of the letters 'b' and 'l', however, we'd get a 100% letter
        match, so not only would we find the two "black" products, we'd also found another product called "stress_ball".

        This algorithm works pretty well when characters are ommited by accident, however, if letters are added by mistake
        or the character order is just input wrong (i.e. typing "balck" instead of "black") it won't find matches as
        easily. This is currently by design, however, and can be changed by added more logic after the below IF statement
